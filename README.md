Project Name : Flight Delays Prediction Using Machine Learning

Skills in prior: Python(Basics for data Analysis,data visualization),Data preprocessing techniques,Machine Learning,Regression and Classification algorithms,Flask integration,Bootstrap,HTML/CSS

Project Description : Our project aims to build a Machine Learning model integrated with a Flask application to predict flight delays.
By analyzing historical flight data,weather conditions,airport congestion and other factors, we develop a predictive model. 
This model is then incorporated into a user-friendly Flask web application,allowing travelers and airlines to anticipate potential delays and plan accordingly,enhancing travel experiences and operational efficiency.

As Github cannot run Flask integrations,I used render to deploy my project.
